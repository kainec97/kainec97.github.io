                         <h3> General Information </h3>
                         My name is Kaine Cochrane. I am currently 19 years old and was born on the
                         11th of October, 1997. At the moment I am living on the Gold Coast,
                         and planning to complete my studies at <a href="http://www.scu.edu.au/" target="_blank">Southern Cross University</a>
                         by February 2018.
                         <br><br>
                         I graduated from Elanora State High School at the end of 2014.
                         During my final year of study there, I received direct entry into Southern Cross
                         University, and started my Bachelor of IT in early 2015.
                         <br>
                         <h3> Hobbies and Interests </h3>
                         <p>
                              My main interest is IT (such as dealing with computer hardware, software and
                              video games) although I have an interest in music (both in terms of recreation and
                              production, although the latter I have not delved into too deeply as of  yet) and art
                              (although I have very limited experience in drawing but wish to pursue it as a hobby
                              sometime soon) as well. I’ve been interested in IT for practically my whole life, using
                              computers since I was around 5 years old and recently building a computer for a friend
                              and my mother (both of which are still running well). My interest in videos
                              games stems from the fact I have been playing them from a young age, and dabbled in
                              some basic video game development both at school and at home (as well as some 3D
                              modelling).

                         <h3> Plans for the Future </h3>
                         So, as you may expect, I’m striving to find a career in IT at some point in my life
                         (hopefully not long after I graduate from University). I have completed my first and
                         (almost) second year, and expecting to complete the entire three year course.
                         I'm hoping to achieve a career in IT by:
                         <br><br>
                         Finding a part-time job that relates to IT in some way (although not compulsory
                         it would assist greatly),
                         <br>
                         completing the Bachelor of IT course successfully and achieving high grades, and
                         <br>
                         searching for full-time employment in the field not long after graduating.
                         <br>
                         <p>
                              At the time of writing (December 2016), the career choice I am most invested in is
                              web design/development. While this isn't a concrete decision, it's the one I am
                              currently most confident with.
                         </p>
