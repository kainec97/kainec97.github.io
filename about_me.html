					<h3>General Information</h3>
					<p>
						My name is Kaine Cochrane. I am currently 20 years old and was born on the
						11th of October, 1997. At the moment I am living in south Brisbane (Calamvale),
						and have recently completed my studies at <a href="http://www.scu.edu.au/">Southern Cross University</a>. 
						I'll be graduating in March of 2018.
					</p>
					<p>
						I graduated from Elanora State High School at the end of 2014.
						During my final year of study there, I received direct entry into Southern Cross
						University via the STAR Entry Scheme, and started my Bachelor of IT in early 2015.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
					<p> 
						My main interest is IT (computer hardware, software and
						video games). I also have an interest in music (in terms of recreation and
						production, although the latter I have not delved into too deeply as of  yet).
						I’ve been interested in IT for practically my whole life, using
						computers since I was around 5 years old and recently building a computer for a friend
						and my mother. My interest in videos games stems from the fact I have been playing them
						from a young age, and attempted some basic video game development both at school and 
						at home (as well as some 3D modelling in Blender).
